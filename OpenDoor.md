## Business Activities
--- 
OpenDoor's business model is simple. They buy a property, renovate it and then sell for a profit. Typical real estate transaction takes about 90-days which can turn into an exhausting process. OpenDoor eases this process into only a few clicks. OpenDoor works like Amazon but for houses where you can buy and sell your properties online. But homeowners usually go through a lot of stressful steps to actually own a home. They usually have to sell the house they currently live in to try to fund for the new house. Homeownners need to get this timing of selling their house and buying a new house just right in order to directly move to their new house. Opendoor simplifies this process by buying the house that needs to be sold on their platform. For further convenience, OpenDoor also has a 30 day return policy if the homeowner is not completely satisfied with their new home. 

OpenDoor Claims that their target audience is not only Millenials because they seem to have a digital-first approach in the market. OpenDoor's purpose is to find home for all those that put convenience first when it comes to buying or selling their homes. OpenDoor's competition ranges widely as it falls under the Fintech and real estate business. It's competitor can be any company all the way from local realtors such as Remax to other Fintech companies that lists residential properties online like Zillow and Realtor.com. OpenDoor is obviously known for being a convenient platform but it holds major competitive advantages against companies like Zillow and Offerpad by offering a 14-day late checkout (rent) option, Being nation's largest home trade-in program, and has the largest network of partnerships with homebuilders like Toll Brothers and Lennar.

## Landscape
---
Opendoor falls under the real estate side of the industry even though it is a Fintech company. However, there are a lot of tech start ups that have tried to create a market in the real estate industry. For exampl, companies such as DocuSign and Dotloop have been successful in bringing the transaction process for properties online. A company called Notarize are making notarization of documents online possible via webcam so real estate transactions can be done from anywhere. A blockchain company such as Propy has established a platform for property transfers by using Ethereum as a base currency via smart contracts for buyers and sellers. Even though these are the early days of innovations in the real estate there is still a lot of potential for the overall industry to grow with technology being the ever changing factor.

## Results
---
OpenDoor has paved a path to become a prominent online real estate company with its balance sheets growing each year. However, this serves as a great checkpoint to assess the company's progress and can it sustain it for the years to come? When it comes to detecting risk in the market, OpenDoor has been on top of its game. The company can monitor price and market liquidity to detect if there will, in fact be a downturn and minimize loss by either adjusting fees, prices or even rent the property. Also, assuming that the company will only grow in size it can diversify its portfolio into different asset and market type since it is less likely they all will collapse at once. 

But let's say that Opendoor is able to predict the next economic downturn, it will still face challenges to survive through it. Though diversification across all US market lessens the risk the last financial crisis in 2008 suggests that the real estate market is the most vulnerable to an economic downturn and can take years to recover. The company would require immense capital and would have to stay liquid all throughout the downturn to be able to make it out of it.

## Recommendations

OpenDoor has been a very risk averse player in it's industry which is why it has been able to grow for so long. But sustaining this growth rate comes with a lot of hurdles. As technology advances, competition will catch up to OpenDoors pace. So the company needs to be prepared for new entrants and ways to tackle newer challengers. They can do this by serving the customers better by giving them a better price for their property. Most of the revenue of the company comes from the margin of buying and selling homes and those margins are rather thin even after charging the customer at or above market price. So this makes it hard for the company to generate revenue, serve its customers to a desirable level and tackle the competition from gaining market share all at the same time. To handle this hurdle, the company must cut down the margins further to stay competitive which may stun the revenue growth but it will definitely cover more market and make up for the revenue with more sales. 

Another hurdle the company faces is issuing more debt during an economic downturn. The company must have investors with deep pockets lined up for them if a market correction is due to happen. Though this is still a secondary challenge since the company has decided to go public, it should still keep it fresh on its mind and stay prepared if a downturn comes.

OpenDoor has an overall sustainable model with an enormous market potential but it should stay cautious of any new entrants or economic crisis.
